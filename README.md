# **PatrOwl**
[PatrOwl](https://www.patrowl.io/) is a scalable, free and open-source solution for orchestrating Security Operations.

**PatrowlManager** is the Front-end application for managing the assets, reviewing risks on real-time, orchestrating the operations (scans, searches, API calls, ...), aggregating the results, relaying alerts on third parties (ex: Incident Response platform like [TheHive](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive/), SIEM, ...) and providing the reports and dashboards.  
**PatrowlEngines** is the engine framework and the supported list of engines performing the operations (scans, searches, API calls, ...) on due time.
